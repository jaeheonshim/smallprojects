# Welcome to "smallprojects"
Welcome to smallprojects, my github repository for small projects that don't deserve their own separate repository. They are still fun and interesting nevertheless. Enjoy!

## [Learning Goal Generator](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Learning%20Goal%20Generator)
*Python*
In my seventh grade years, I would always dislike coming up with a learning goal for my classes. So I created a simple python program that does it for me! The python script basically chooses a goal randomly each day, and sometimes it even incorporates a assignment goal into the learning goal. You can guess how much I hated doing actual work. I wrote this a while, so the code is... meh. It still works though.

## [Love Tester](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Love%20Tester)
*Python*
This is a love tester that calculates the probability of a match between two people. Why did I make this? Because 7th grade. However, this is not your ordinary love tester. It can be configured to accept two names. When these two names are entered into the tester, it will always output a 100% chance. I just thought that would be a useful feature. Also, the names you configure in the code are masked by a simple cipher algorithm, so friends looking into your code won't accidentally discover your backdoor.

## [Prime Numbers](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Prime%20Numbers)
*Java*
This program calculates prime numbers. Nothing I can say could possibly add to this. May the great search for the mesenne primes begin!!!

## [Popup Blocked](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Popup%20Blocked)
*JavaScript*
This is a simple JavaScript function that returns true if the browser is blocking popups, and false if the browser allows popups. I figured it could be useful in helping users disable popup blockers if needed for a website to serve its purpose.
