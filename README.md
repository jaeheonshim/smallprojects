# Welcome to "smallprojects"
Welcome to smallprojects, my github repository for small projects that don't deserve their own separate repository. These are bits of code and small programs I work on in my free time, just for fun. They might not be as advanced and useful as the large-scale projects I build, buthey are still fun and interesting nevertheless. Feel free to use the code in this repository as you wish, as long as you follow the terms of the [license](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/blob/master/LICENSE). Enjoy!

## [Learning Goal Generator](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Learning%20Goal%20Generator)
*Python*
In my seventh grade years, I would always dislike coming up with a learning goal for my classes. So I created a simple python program that does it for me! The python script basically chooses a goal randomly each day, and sometimes it even incorporates a assignment goal into the learning goal. You can guess how much I hated doing actual work. I wrote this a while, so the code is... meh. It still works though.

## [Love Tester](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Love%20Tester)
*Python*
This is a love tester that calculates the probability of a match between two people. Why did I make this? Because 7th grade. However, this is not your ordinary love tester. It can be configured to accept two names. When these two names are entered into the tester, it will always output a 100% chance. I just thought that would be a useful feature. Also, the names you configure in the code are masked by a simple cipher algorithm, so friends looking into your code won't accidentally discover your backdoor.

## [Prime Numbers](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Prime%20Numbers)
*Java*
This program calculates prime numbers. Nothing I can say could possibly add to this. May the great search for the mesenne primes begin!!!

## [Popup Blocked](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Popup%20Blocked)
*JavaScript*
This is a simple JavaScript function that returns true if the browser is blocking popups, and false if the browser allows popups. I figured it could be useful in helping users disable popup blockers if needed for a website to serve its purpose.

## [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Fibonacci%20Sequence)
*Java*
This Java program generates numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequene is the sum of the last two numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ...). Simply enter the largest number you would like to increment to in the sequence as a variable in the code, and execute the code to have the Fibonacci Sequence printed in the console.

## [Hangman](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Hangman)
*Java*
This is a fun console hangman game written in Java. The objective of the game is to guess the correct word in a limited number of tries or less. The number of tries can be customized in the program. Also, a custom word can be specified in the program, or it can be set to use a random word from a list of 800 words.  
  
To specify options, edit the constructor from when the Hangman object is created in the main method.  
  
- Hangman("apple") will create a hangman game with the objective word set as apple.  
- Hangman("apple", 10) will create a hangman game with the objective word set as apple AND the number of tries set to 10 (Default is 7).  
- Hangman(true) will create a hangman game with a random objective word.  
- Hangman(true, 10) will create a hangman game with a random objective word and the number of tries set to 10.  

PS - There isn't an actual hangman, I couldn't draw one in Unicode art. The program just tells you how many tries you have remaining.

## [Dice](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Hangman)
*Python*
This script is literally 9 lines of code that generate a random number between 1 and 6. The user can then choose whether they would like to generate another random number.

## [Pig Latin Translator](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/Pig%20Latin%20Translator)
*Java*
The Java class in this repository can be used to translate English into grammatically correct pig latin.

Pig Latin Rules  
- If a word starts with a consonant and a vowel, put the first letter of the word at the end of the word and add "ay."
- If a word starts with two consonants move the two consonants to the end of the word and add "ay."
- If a word starts with a vowel add the word "way" at the end of the word.  

Examples  
Pig Latin is hard to speak.  
igpay atinlay isway ardhay otay eakspay.  

Quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

## [leetspeak](https://github.com/jaeheonshim/smallprojects/tree/master/leetspeak)
*Python*
This script converts normal english text to 1337 text. There are two modes, one where only the letters that make sense in 1337 speak are converted, and the other where all letters are converted. I find the latter to be barely readable.
